# Prusa i3 Mk3s Presets for PrusaSlicer 2.0.0+win64

I don't use basically any of the filament brands/materials that Prusa has settings for, and I got tired of trawling forums for settings and tweaking printer parameters. So! Here is my bundle of different custom settings.

Note: I have not upgraded my nozzle yet, and at this point I have an enclosure installed.

There are custom print resolution settings for different materials (ie, retraction speed changes), and the filament brands I current have settings for are:
* eSun
* Polymaker

Need to document settings for:
* Tttyt3D

* NinjaTek
* CC3D
* Taulman
